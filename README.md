Hey everyone
This is the repository to my Master's thesis project and it's based on the work of F.Abdelghany in this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221707000835
right now i'm just trying to implement the author's exact methodology based on data from ROADED 2009 competition(https://www.roadef.org/challenge/2009/en/).
I would be realy honored if anyone out there took the time to make any suggestions or contributions to improve to or accelerate the pace  of the project.
If you feel any clarifications are needed; don't hesitate to contact me directly via: Shayan.Mousavi@aut.ac.ir
Thank's to you all.
Love 
S.M
